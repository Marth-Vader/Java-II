Project 3: Java Collections Framework

Learning Objectives:

1. Make use of HashMaps and TreeMaps to flexibly store data in a structure that is efficient to access
2. Compute statistics over the stored data in a manner that does not rely on a prior knowledge of the specifics of the data
3. Continue to exercise good coding practices for Javadocs and for unit testing
