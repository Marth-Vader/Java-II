Project 5: Java Graphics

Learning Objectives:

1. Create a tree data structure for representing a kinematic tree
2. Create a class for flexibly transforming 3D data into a 2D picture
3. Use JSliders to accept input
4. Use Timers to create animations
5. Continue to exercise good coding practices for Javadoc and for testing

Project 5 implements components from Projects 1-4. This final project will:

1. Allow the user to specify an infant, whose data are to be loaded
2. Allow the user to select one of the available weeks associated with the infant
3. Allow the user to specify a time within the week to render
4. Render a top, side and rear view of the infantâ€™s skeleton
