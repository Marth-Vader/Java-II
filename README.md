# Programming Structures and Abstractions

Projects from Programming Structures and Abstractions. Each project builds on top of the previous one, implementing new features using new programming concepts. The focus is of these projects is to read in and analyze position data collected from a Self-Initiated Prone Progression Crawler (SIPPC), a robot that encourages movement in infants at rise for cerebral palsy as they learn how to crawl. A kinematic capture suit is worn by the infant to record position coordinates. As the projects build on each other, more data is provided and the programs are able to do more with the given data. The final goal of these projects is to create a GUI that will display the position of an infant at a certain time in a certain trial and then display the infant as a stick figure. 

JUnit tests are included for each project.
